# Project Name
The objective is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
	- The objective is the model the demand of the shared bikes and what factors affect them.
- What is the background of your project?
	- The project uses Linear Regression to solve the bussiness objective.
- What is the dataset that is being used?
	- Bike Rental Dataset is being used.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Temperature seems to be having major effect in the bike renatl, since its coefficient is the highest of all.
- More bikes are rented in the month of september
- Windspeed has significant effect on the bike rentals where as it reduces the rental count. That could mean that bikes are less likely to be rented when there is high windspeed.
- People are more likely to borrow bikes on winter than in summer.
